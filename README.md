# Three Most Popular Disney Songs

## 1. "Let It Go" - "(Frozen)"

**Movie"** *Frozen*
**Singer:** Idina Menzel as Elsa
**Composer:** Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez

### Description

In the movie, Elsa sings "Let it Go" from her place of isolation. She's frustrated at the way she's been forced to hide what she is capable of and, over the course of the song, resolves to accept her powers rather than live in fear of them.

## 2. "Circle of Life" - "(The Lion King)"

**Movie:** *The Lion King*
**Singer:** Carmen Twillie
**Composer:** Elton John and Tim Rice

### Description

In the case of the context of the song, it's a creative delivery to convey the circle of life and its meaning. Circles have no beginnings or end. If we start anywhere on a circle, and follow it around, we end up in a loop coming back to where we started. The Lion King's main theme was all about the cycle of life and death, and so it is with the circles of life in pastures.

## 3. "A Whole New World" - "(Aladdin)"

**Movie"** *Aladdin*
**Singer:** Brad Kane as Aladdin and Lea Salonga as Princess Jasmine
**Composer:** Alan Menken and Tim Rice

### Description

Lyrically, A Whole New World describes Aladdin showing the confined princess a life of freedom and the pair's acknowledgement of their love for each other on top of that, while riding on a flying magic carpet.
